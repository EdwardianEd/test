Part One: Avarice

The story of Avarice Van Evier is a tragic one, and shall be told anyway.

To those that did not know her, she was a figurehead - royalty of the upper class in Menzoberranzan. She was her parents’ angelic sole heir, even when they were preoccupied with business or adultery. Her father Pharius - the one that named her - was a business owner, made rich by the booming (...or boozing) success of Van Evier Spirits, a high-end liquor company. But Avarice took after her mother Chandra; a socialite, who spent her days taking just enough narcotics to ignore the gossip that constantly followed her. 

To those that did know her, she was royalty of a different kind. If there was a party, it was guaranteed Avarice Van Evier would be there. If she wasn’t, there was no point in turning up. The room revolved around her - men and women alike craned their necks to catch her eye, nearly clambering over each other to exchange mere pleasantries. By the age of 20, she had put enough illicit substances in her body to kill a small dragon, and the young, bored, filthy rich kids of Menzoberranzan loved her for it.

To those who truly knew her - which was a group consisting of exactly one person, her maid Imrae - she was, physically and mentally, unstable. In a constant state of paranoia that she was on the brink of social collapse, Avarice would seek intimacy with all manner of people, while simultaneously isolating herself from truly connecting with anyone for fear of her vulnerability being used against her.

That was, until she met Cormorant Yril’Lysaen.

You’d be wrong to call it love, of course. That was something neither of them had the capabilities for. But she was a pretty girl that kept his bed warm in a city he didn’t know, and he was someone that wouldn’t sell her secrets for pocket change, and that worked for them for a little while.

Maybe it was because they were young - her 23 and him 26 - that they lost sight of the long term. Maybe it was because they were drunk, as they so often were, and just forgot. But one thing led to another, and Avarice - not at all joyfully - found herself expecting.

Mister Yril’Lysaen did not like this. A child out of wedlock, even in drow society, would throw both of their families into disrepute. On the day he ended whatever it was that they had, he made it very clear that he valued his reputation over her, which shouldn’t have been a surprise, but Avarice had allowed herself the luxury of hoping.

Never again.

She decided to ignore the parasite inside of her, and the dull ache in her bones from the loss of her sole confidant. She threw herself into socialising - as far she was concerned, it was a new and better-than-ever era for Avarice. She’d heard tell from some ‘friends’ about an experimental new substance, something to do with mushrooms, that was supposed to be more potent than anything she’d tried before. Perfect. Just what she needed.

The mushrooms glowed blue. They were perfect, the first couple of times she tried them. By the third, she’d got used to the high. By the fifth, she was dreading the come-down. By the tenth, she’d made friends with the brightly coloured creatures that joined her during a high. The creatures had sharp teeth. She asked them if they’d be so kind as to use them to cure her ailment, and they gladly obliged. Anything for you, Avie, they’d said. She’d cried. She’d never had a nickname before.

She awoke in the bathroom, covered in glowing blue blood, and breathed a sigh of relief. She didn’t understand the horror on Imrae’s face when she told her about the kind creatures and their teeth.

Somehow, Cormorant Yril’Lysaen got wind of these events and, in a stroke of absolute genius, decided to confront her about them.

She barely remembered the conversation. He was there, suddenly. Then they were shouting. He put his hands on her. Then he was on the ground at the bottom of the staircase, purple blood staining his white hair, neck at an odd angle. He looked so small, she’d thought from the top of the staircase.

Her parents were some of the most influential people in Menzoberranzan, so of course she didn’t have anything to worry about. She had parties to go to, after all. It was the Spidermoon Gala that night. She went high.

She could’ve sworn she saw him. She turned and ran. Fell. There was a crash, somewhere. She was covered in glowing blue blood. She knew they knew.

She left Menzoberranzan that night.










Part Two: Sorn

She walked until the high faded, and all that was left was shame over what she’d thrown away. She walked until that faded, too. She walked until all she could recall were flashes of what had been, indistinguishable to her from what might have been. She walked until she lost her name.

She didn’t know where she was walking to, or eventually where she was walking from either.

She hadn’t even realised the landscape had changed until she reached it.

It was almost the same as her mushrooms in colour and in shape, except it stretched higher than anything she’d ever seen, illuminating the surrounding Underdark with a gentle blue glow. Similar, smaller ones stretched out for what seemed like miles.

It spoke to her.

Child, it said. How long I have waited.

Where am I? she asked. Her voice ached from disuse.

Home, it replied. And oh, it had been so long since she had heard that word and understood what it meant. And she knew what she was meant to do. 

Protect it.

It named her; Sorn. 

In return, she named it; Vdre’taur. 

And it was hers, and she was its, and everything was okay as it had always been for she had always been here.

Then wilt, and decay. 

It started at the outskirts. She noticed it on a patrol.

After that, it crept closer and closer to the heart of the Forest.

She tried everything. The Forest had lent her its strength for her duties as S’argt almost five years ago, but nothing she tried seemed to work. 

Child, it said. You must voyage. To bring strength back to Forest, and to bring Rest to the Surface.

Sorn wept. She understood her task, but leaving the Forest sent an almost-familiar dull ache through her bones.

But she drew herself together. She picked up her staff and holstered her pack, and set off for the surface.
